* Supports global callback configuration
* Supports priority response and interrupt response
* Supports recording call paths to address the issue of not being able to trace `Observable` in observer mode during debugging

### Purpose of Action

An `Action` is essentially a global system callback used for a series of pre-embedded operations, such as displaying pop-ups, uploading logs, and clearing caches.

When users perform certain operations (e.g., open a specific page, click a button in H5, or trigger a dynamically configured click event), it will automatically be triggered to execute the pre-embedded logic of the action.

On Android, there are many capabilities to achieve similar functionality, such as `broadcast`, `EventBus`, `Flow`, `LiveData`, and other observer pattern frameworks. However, they all have a serious problem: notifications are untraceable, meaning message flooding. When there are many messages, it's challenging to know where a particular message was sent from and which places received this message.

Similar to Android's built-in broadcast notifications, you can declare actions and their handling methods anywhere. However, within TheRouter, all `Action`s can be traced. If you are willing, you can output the call stack of all actions in logs, making it convenient for debugging. During development, you can directly jump to the location of message sending and receiving through the IDE plugin.

#### Purpose and Response Process

### Action Usage

Declare an Action:

```java
// It is recommended that actions follow a certain format
const val ACTION = "therouter://action/xxx"

@FlowTask(taskName="action_demo")
fun init(context: Context) =
    TheRouter.addActionInterceptor(ACTION, object: ActionInterceptor() {
        override fun handle(context: Context, args: Bundle): Boolean {
            // do something
            return false
        }
    })
```

Starting from 1.1.3-rc1, Actions also support annotation declaration, and you can declare them as follows:

```java
@ActionInterceptor(actionName = "action_demo")
public class TestActionInterceptor extends ActionInterceptor {

    @Override
    public boolean handle(@NonNull Context context, @NonNull Navigator navigator) {
        Toast.makeText(context, HomePathIndex.ACTION2, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        // true means blocking (consume), false means continue to pass, usually false
        return super.handle(context, navigator);
    }
}

```

### Execute an Action:

```java
// It is recommended that actions follow a certain format
const val ACTION = "therouter://action/xxx"

// If an undeclared Action is executed, there will be no action
TheRouter.build(ACTION).action()

```

### Advanced Usage  

Each Action allows association with multiple ActionInterceptors for processing. Multiple ActionInterceptors can customize interceptor priorities and allow termination of the execution of lower-priority interceptors.  
A typical application scenario is that the homepage may have multiple pop-ups, and pop-ups between different businesses have priority. To optimize the experience, we won't display all pop-ups on the homepage at once. You can use ActionInterceptor to declare the priority relationship for each pop-up. Suppose the requirement is that the homepage can only display three pop-ups. After the third pop-up is processed, the current event can be closed, and subsequent interceptors will not be responded to.  

```java
abstract class ActionInterceptor {

    abstract fun handle(context: Context, args: Bundle): Boolean

    fun onFinish() {}

    /**
     * The larger the number, the higher the priority
     */
    open val priority: Int
        get() = 5
}

```
