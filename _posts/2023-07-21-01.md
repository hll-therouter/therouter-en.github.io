If you are unable to resolve your issue, we recommend registering your application to receive priority technical support. You can do this by visiting [https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-therouter-android/issues/57](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-therouter-android/issues/57).  
 

### The problem list is updated periodically....

#### Q1: **Route Table Not Generated (or Generated Code Has Compilation Errors)**

Please follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Have you added the plugin? The plugin must be added and can only be added in the app module.
2. Have you added kapt? Kapt should not only be added to the bottom-most module, but to all modules where annotations are used.
3. Are the versions of router, plugin, and kapt dependencies consistent?
4. Check your JDK information here: `Preferences -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Gradle JDK`. Do not use the JDK that comes with Android Studio; there may be compatibility issues with KSP. Please download from the Oracle official website: [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/hk/java/technologies/downloads/#java17), [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/hk/java/technologies/downloads/#java11), [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/hk/java/technologies/downloads/#java8).
5. Try updating to the latest rc version to see if the issue is resolved. [Version List](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-therouter-android/releases)

#### Q5: **How to Use TheRouter in Multiple Processes**

[https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/09/03/01](https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/09/03/01)

#### Q6: **Using Multiple Service Providers for the Same Service Name**

Please refer to the documentation in the "1.3 Service Provider" section: [https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/08/27/01](https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/08/27/01)

---

#### Q7: **Using TheRouter in Multiple Processes**

TheRouter supports routing in multiple processes, but by default, it only initializes in the main process. If you are using multiple processes, you can disable the automatic initialization of TheRouter and manually perform initialization in the `onCreate()` of your `Application` class.

```java
override fun attachBaseContext(base: Context) {
    super.attachBaseContext(base)
    theRouterUseAutoInit = false
}

override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    TheRouter.init(this)
}
```

**Note**:

- 1. For multi-process `ServiceProvider`, TheRouter supports data retrieval across processes, but the data being retrieved needs to be process-compatible. Think of TheRouter as a channel that connects two processes. To pass data from one process to another, the data itself needs to be receivable by the other process.
- 2. Cross-process dependencies for `FlowTask` are not currently supported but are expected to be supported in version 1.2.2.
- 3. Cross-process responses for `ActionManager` are not currently supported but are expected to be supported in version 1.2.2.

---

#### Q8: **Custom Log Output**

By default, TheRouter will print logs to the console in debug mode and will not output anything in release mode. If you want to collect logs in the production environment, you can customize the log output for the release scenario:

```java
override fun onCreate() {
    // It is recommended to place this before Application.onCreate() to avoid executing default logic before assignment.
    TheRouter.logCat = { tag, msg ->  
        // Implement your log reporting logic here
    }
    super.onCreate()
}
```
--- 
#### Q9: Check if a String is a Router Path

```java
// Check if it's a router landing page path
TheRouter.isRouterPath(path): Boolean  

// Check if it's an Action
TheRouter.isRouterAction(path): Boolean
```

--- 

#### Q10: Export Router History Records

If you need to record user history operations for error tracing and playback, you can directly use the history record export feature:

```java
// There are a total of 8 states for the level
val NONE // Do not export any data
val ACTIVITY // Export only Activity's router operations
val FRAGMENT // Export only Fragment's router operations
val PAGE  // Export router operations of Fragment + Activity
val ACTION  // Export ActionManager's operation records
val SERVICE_PROVIDER // Export ServiceProvider's records
val FLOW_TASK // Export FlowTaskExecutor's history records
val ALL // Export all records

// You can stack 8 states together, for example
val level = ACTIVITY + ACTION + FLOW_TASK

export(level).forEach {
    info.append(it).append('\n').append('\n')
}
```

#### Q11: Import and Export Intent Objects to Router

There are some special business scenarios where you may need to use `Intent` objects as parameters, for example, when handling notification clicks and only `Intent` parameters are provided by the system, or when using the new API `ActivityResultLauncher` to replace `startActivityForResult()`. TheRouter also supports such usage scenarios:

Import Intent:

```java
TheRouter.build(intent).withXxxxx().navigation()
```

Export Intent:

```java
// Note: When exporting an Intent, the URL must have a corresponding landing page, otherwise the Intent will not carry the parameters from withXXX().
val intent = TheRouter.build(url).withXxxxx().createIntent()
```

--- 

#### Q12: Integration in Plugin Projects

TheRouter's route table is completely dynamic, allowing for dynamic loading of plugin route tables. There are many existing pluginization frameworks on the market, so you can refer to the specific pluginization solution you are using. When a plugin is loaded, call the following code in an asynchronous thread:

```java
// Execute in a background thread
execute {
    // Initialize dependency injection within the plugin
    TheRouterServiceProvideInjecter.trojan();
    // Initialize FlowTask within the plugin
    TheRouterServiceProvideInjecter.addFlowTask(context, TheRouter.digraph);
    // Initialize the route table within the plugin
    TheRouterServiceProvideInjecter.initDefaultRouteMap();
}
```

#### Q13: Integration in Mixed Projects like Flutter/RN/WEEX

TheRouter's route table is completely dynamic, allowing for the dynamic loading of route tables in cross-platform projects.

You can directly configure the route table in the `/assets/RouteMap.json` file.
If the URLs in the route table follow a pattern, you can simply load them all at once using regular expressions.

```json
[
  {
    "path": "https://kymjs.com/flutter/\\S*",
    "className": "com.therouter.FlutterActivity",
    "action": "",
    "description": "",
    "params": {
      "key": "value"
    }
  },
  ......
  // Add other route tables
  ......
]
```

#### Q14: My project uses Gradle 8.x (or AGP 8), and I'm having trouble importing the plugin

Please carefully review the integration documentation [https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/11/23/01](https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/11/23/01), and read through the section "Step 1: Classpath Integration" thoroughly.
