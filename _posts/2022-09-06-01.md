TheRouter's version planning is divided into three types: `Stable Version`, `Preview Version` (including beta version), and `Public Beta Version`.

## Stable Version

The stable version is always packaged and released on the `main` branch, and the latest stable version is the latest code on the `main` branch.

You can find the latest stable version on the GitHub releases page.
[https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-therouter-android/releases](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-therouter-android/releases)  

The version number format for the stable version is `x.y.z`, and the latest stable version will have a green `Latest` label.

## Preview Version

The preview version is an integration of `feature` and `bugfix` over a period of time, representing code that is about to be merged into the `main` branch.

The latest preview version will be marked as `Pre-release` on [GitHub's releases page](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-therouter-android/releases), and its version number typically includes the `-rc` tag.

The preview version can be obtained directly from the `mavenCentral()` repository, without special treatment. It is suitable for developers who seek new features and specific bug fixes.


## Beta Preview Version

The `beta` preview version generally refers to a version that will not release a `release` in the near future but is available for users who want to try out certain specific features.

The `beta` preview version will be marked as `Pre-release` on [GitHub's releases page](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-therouter-android/releases), with the version number typically including the `-beta` tag.

The preview version can be directly obtained from the `mavenCentral()` repository, without special treatment. It is suitable for developers who are after new features and specific bug fixes.

## Public Beta Version

The public beta version is packaged for every new `feature` or `bugfix`. It will not be displayed separately on the releases page, but you can actively check for the latest public beta version on Maven.

The public beta version generally does not have a special tag, but you need to include the public beta repository in your `build.gradle`.  

```gradle
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/staging/' }
}

```
