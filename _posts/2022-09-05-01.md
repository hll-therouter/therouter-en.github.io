`TheRouter` provides a graphical interface migration tool that allows for one-click migration from other routing solutions to `TheRouter`.  

The new migration tool has been integrated into the AndroidStudio development plugin and can be downloaded directly from the AS plugin market. For more information, please visit: [https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/09/29/01](https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/09/29/01)  

## Precautions  

Issues reported by users: When using the `Windows` system for migration, encoding problems may occur. As the migration tool uses `UTF-8` encoding for file reading and writing, it is advised to set the project encoding to `UTF-8` before migrating. Android Studio supports modifying project encoding: `Setting -> Editor -> File Encodings`, change `Global Encoding` and `Project Encoding` to `UTF-8`.

## Parts That Require Manual Modification

1. The `Provider.init` part of ARouter is recommended to be changed to a lazy loading method. Initiate the init method yourself when the service method is called.

2. If you are using ARouter's interceptors, you will need to manually handle the interceptor logic. All ARouter interceptors can be replaced by TheRouter's interceptors. For specific logic, please refer to: TheRouter Page Jump: 【[Part Three](https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/08/28/01)】Custom Handlers.

3. ARouter encapsulates a large number of Bundle passing operations, such as `withBooleanArray()`. We believe such encapsulation is redundant. If you have used the corresponding methods, in TheRouter you can directly call the corresponding methods on the Bundle object. For example:

	```java
	// ARouter 
	ARouter.getInstance()
		.build(path)
		.withByteArray(key, value)
		.withStringArrayList(key, value as ArrayList<String>)
		.navigation()
	
	// TheRouter
	TheRouter.build("")
		.fillParams { bundle ->
		    bundle.putByteArray(key, value)
		    bundle.putStringArrayList(key, value)
		}.navigation()
	
	```

4. The implementation difference of `with(bundle)`. In ARouter, the with operation is a collective one. If the key in the bundle conflicts with the key in `withString(key, value)`, the latter will override the former.
In `TheRouter`, the with operation introduces an additional object without causing an override, but it needs to be obtained through the `@Autowired` annotation on the landing page.
If you want `with(bundle)` to be directly accessible through the intent, you can use the following code:

	```java
	ARouter.build().with(yourBundle).navigate()
	
	TheRouter.build("")
		.fillParams { bundle ->
		    bundle.putAll(yourBundle)
		}.navigation()
	
	```

No other parts requiring manual modification have been found so far.

## Migration Suggestions

To prevent import errors related to `ARouter` references during coding after migration completion, it is advised to manually check and delete all `ARouter` references. Configure the following code in each module's `build.gradle` to filter out related references. This way, if a reference error occurs, it will be caught during compilation, helping to identify issues early.   

```java
configurations {
    all*.exclude group: 'com.alibaba', module: 'arouter-api'
    all*.exclude group: 'com.alibaba', module: 'arouter-annotation'
}

```
