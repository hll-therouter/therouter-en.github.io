Modular capabilities include:

- Support for cross-module dependency injection
- Custom creation rules for injecting items, with the ability to customize injection parameters
- Custom service interception, enabling single-module mock debugging
- Object caching for injections, ensuring an object is instantiated only once across multiple injections

### 1. Dependency Injection

Used for cross-module communication, the core design philosophy is inspired by the [Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/%E9%9D%A2%E5%90%91%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%93%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84#). On the Android side, it is implemented similarly to AIDL:

For example, consider two modules: Module A (Order) and Module B (Login). Placing an order requires fetching user information. In this scenario, Module A needs to use a service to obtain user information, while Module B needs to provide a service for fetching user information externally.

#### 1.1 Declare Interface Service

First, declare an interface and place it in the common dependency layer.

```java
// Assuming there is currently a user information retrieval service
public interface IUserService {
    String getUserInfo();
}
```

#### 1.2 Service Consumer

In the example above, Module A, the order module, needs to use the user information retrieval service. Module A doesn't need to know who provides the IUserService interface service; it only needs to know that it requires such a service.

Note: If there is no service provider, TheRouter.get() may return null.

```java
TheRouter.get(IUserService::class.java)?.getUserInfo()
```

#### 1.3 Service Provider

The service provider needs to declare a method that provides the service, marked with the `@ServiceProvider` annotation.

- For Java, the method must be `public static`.
- For Kotlin, it is recommended to write it as a `top-level` function.
- The method name is not restricted.

```java
/**
 * The method name is not restricted; any name will do.
 * The return value must be the service interface name. If it is a subclass implementing the service, the `returnType` qualifier must be added (as shown in the example below).
 * The method must be marked with `public static`, or else there will be a compilation error.
 */
@ServiceProvider
public static IUserService test() {
    return new IUserService() {
        @Override
        public String getUserInfo() {
            return "user info.....";
        }
    };
}

// Alternatively, you can directly return an object and annotate the method with the desired service name.
@ServiceProvider(returnType = IUserService.class)
public static UserServiceImpl test() {
    xxx
}
```

**Note**: Each service should only have one service provider. Having multiple interface implementation classes, as seen in `ARouter`, is considered not compliant with the service-oriented design specification. If you need multiple services and want the consumer to decide which service to use at runtime, consider the following alternatives:

Recommended approach: Define different service providers as separate interfaces.
If two different services are in the same module: Create a custom service provider method that controls which service to return.
For unidirectional services (business logic not dependent on the interface method return value): Use `ActionManager` as a replacement for implementation.


### 2. Custom Service Interceptor  

**Scenario**: When debugging a single module, there may be a need to mock services provided by other modules, and TheRouter allows customization of the implementation of other modules.   

```java
Interceptor interceptor = new Interceptor() {
    @Override
    public <T> T interception(Class<T> clazz, Object... params) {
        if (clazz == IUserService.class) {
            return new IUserService();
        }
        return null;
    }
};
TheRouter.getRouterInject().addInterceptor(interceptor);
```

### 3. Service Provider Cache

To declare the caching strategy for a service, you can add additional annotations, such as `@Singleton` or `@NewInstance`, to the service interface contract. These annotations are used to indicate how the service provider configures the caching of service instances.

- `@Singleton` indicates that the service instance will be permanently cached, making it equivalent to declaring the object as a singleton for external calling parties.
- `@NewInstance` indicates that a new service instance will be returned with each service invocation.

**Note**: If both `@Singleton` and `@NewInstance` annotations are added simultaneously, only `@Singleton` will take effect.

**Note**: `@Singleton` and `@NewInstance` should be added to the service interface contract.

```java

// Note: If none are added, the default is LRU + Soft Reference caching.
// If both annotations are added simultaneously, only Singleton will take effect.
@Singleton // Equivalent to declaring this object as a singleton for external calling parties
@NewInstance // A new object will be returned with each invocation
public interface IUserService {
    public String getUserInfo();
}


@ServiceProvider
public static IUserService test() {
    return new IUserService() {
        @Override
        public String getUserInfo() {
            return "user info ...";
        }
    };
}
```  

### 4. Annotate ServiceProvider on a class

Starting from version 1.1.2-rc7, ServiceProvider supports annotating classes.

```java
@ServiceProvider
public class TestClassAnnotation implements ITestClassAnnotation {
}

TheRouter.get(ITestClassAnnotation.class)
```

If none of the interfaces are implemented, the default return type is the current class itself.

If the class has multiple interfaces to implement, the declaration 'returnType' must be displayed, for example:

```java
@ServiceProvider(returnType = ITestClassAnnotation.class)
public class TestClassAnnotation implements ITestClassAnnotation, ITest0 {
}

TheRouter.get(ITestClassAnnotation.class)
```

### 5. Multi parameter ServiceProvider

#### 5.1 Static methods as ServiceProvider

```java
@ServiceProvider
public static IUserService test(String str) {
    return new IUserService() {
        @Override
        public String getUserInfo() {
            return str;
        }
    };
}

TheRouter.get(IUserService.class, "user Info");
```

#### 5.2 Class object as ServiceProvider

```java
@ServiceProvider(returnType = ITestClassAnnotation.class, params={String.class})
public class TestClassAnnotation implements ITestClassAnnotation, ITest0 {
	public TestClassAnnotation(String str){}
}

TheRouter.get(ITestClassAnnotation.class, "hello")
```

### 6. Set Inherited Service Implementation

If your class has a superclass that implements the interface protocol, and you don't want to explicitly declare `returnType`, as in the example below. We also provide a compilation option for use, add `USE_EXTENSION=true` to the `gradle.properties` file.

**Note**: Please use `USE_EXTENSION` with **caution**. When enabled, all protocol checks will use `isAssignableFrom` for comparison, rather than `equals`, which may have a significant impact on runtime performance.

```java
public class SuperTestClassAnnotation implements ITestClassAnnotation, ITest0 {
}

@ServiceProvider
public class TestClassAnnotation extends SuperTestClassAnnotation{
}

// When `USE_EXTENSION=true` is added to the gradle.properties file,
// it indicates that interface protocols are allowed to have inheritance relationships,
// so you can use the following two protocols to obtain and use services.
TheRouter.get(ITestClassAnnotation.class)
// or
TheRouter.get(ITest0.class)
```
