## Migration Tool

The latest version of the AndroidStudio plugin now perfectly supports a one-click migration tool, eliminating the need to download additional tools separately.    
After downloading and installing the latest plugin, you can see TheRouter menu in the top menu bar. Simply select the one-click migration option for the corresponding route to use it.

## Navigation Quick Jump

Once the plugin is installed and the project is opened, you will notice that in all places where `TheRouter.build(path)` is called in the project, as well as where the `@Route(path = "xxxxx")` annotation is located, there will be an icon with a green arrow on the left sidebar.  

If you hover your mouse over this icon for a while, a tooltip will appear indicating:  
"After clicking, it will navigate to the location where this `path` is used,  
or to the defined location of `path`, and after clicking, it will automatically jump to that location."    
As shown in the following image:

If there are multiple places in the code that can lead to the current landing page, clicking on the arrow will bring up a selection box, allowing you to choose to jump to the location where the current `path` is used.     
For example, like in this image:    

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/image/TheRouterIdeaPlugin2.jpg" class="blog-img">

If the current `path` is undeclared or is composed of string concatenations, there might be instances where the definition location cannot be found. In such cases, a yellow warning prompt will appear on the sidebar,   
indicating that the developer needs to manually check whether the `path` has been forgotten to be defined for the landing page, or if there was a mistake in writing the `path`.  
For example, as shown in this image:

## Get the Latest Version  

There's no longer a need to constantly keep track of TheRouter's version updates. Simply by manually clicking on the menu, you can instantly know the current latest version number.
