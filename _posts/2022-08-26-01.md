title: "Introduction to Automatic Initialization of Business Node Subscription Capability"
description: "In modular development, each module may have its own set of initialization code. The previous approach was to declare all these codes in the Application, but this could lead to the need for modifications in the Application module with each change in business requirements. TheRouter's single-module automatic initialization capability is designed to address this situation. By declaring the initialization method only in the current module, it will be automatically invoked in relevant business."

- Supports independent initialization of single modules.
- Supports lazy loading initialization.
- Independent initialization allows for multiple task dependencies (similar to Gradle Tasks).
- Supports compile-time circular reference detection.
- Allows customizing the business initialization timing.

**Common Use Cases**: In modular development, each module may have its own initialization code. The traditional approach was to declare this code in the `Application``, but this could lead to the need for modifications in the `Application` module every time the business requirements changed. TheRouter's single-module automatic initialization capability is designed to address this situation. After declaring the initialization method in the current module, it will be automatically invoked in the business scenario.

## Introduction to Use

No Need to Worry about Circular Dependencies:
There is no need to worry about issues caused by circular dependencies. The framework constructs a `Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)` during the compilation phase to monitor situations of circular dependencies. If any are detected, an error will be reported during the compilation phase. 

Single Invocation of All Tasks:
All tasks will only be called once within the same process. If you have tasks that need to be called multiple times, you can use ActionManager for handling. Please refer to the relevant documentation for more details.  
[https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/08/25/01](https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/08/25/01)   

You can declare any method with any name in any class in the current module, and simply add the @FlowTask annotation to the method.  

The `@FlowTask` annotation parameters are explained as follows:

- taskName: The unique task name for the current initialization task, recommended format: moduleName_taskName.  
- dependsOn: Similar to Gradle Task, there might be dependencies between tasks. If the current task needs to depend on other tasks to be initialized first, declare the names of the dependent tasks here. You can depend on multiple tasks simultaneously, separated by commas with optional spaces, and they will be filtered: dependsOn = "mmkv, config, login". The default is empty, and it is called when the application is launched. Note: dependsOn only ensures that the task is executed after the dependent tasks, but due to the internal logic being executed on asynchronous threads, it depends on thread switching and may not be executed immediately.   
- async: Whether to execute this task asynchronously, default is false.


```java
/**
 * async thread task
 */
@FlowTask(taskName = "mmkv_init", dependsOn = TheRouterFlowTask.THEROUTER_INITIALIZATION, async = true)
public static void test2(Context context) {
    System.out.println("async thread=========Execute after Application onCreate");
}

@FlowTask(taskName = "app1")
public static void test3(Context context) {
    System.out.println("main thread=========The application will execute upon startup");
}

/**
 * main thread task
 */
@FlowTask(taskName = "test", dependsOn = "mmkv,app1")
public static void test3(Context context) {
    System.out.println("main thread=========It will only be executed after both app1 and mmkv tasks are executed");
}
```

## Built in initialization node

The framework defaultly supports some lifecycle class tasks that can be directly referenced during usage:

- **TheRouterFlowTask.APP_ONCREATE**: (Deprecated; all tasks are by default executed when onCreate() is called, expected to be removed in version 1.1.4)
- **TheRouterFlowTask.APP_ONSPLASH**: Initializes after the first Activity.onCreate() of the application.
- **TheRouterFlowTask.BEFORE_THEROUTER_INITIALIZATION**: Executes tasks after the application starts but before TheRouter initialization. This task cannot be set to execute asynchronously. Considering it's a niche use case and might complicate support, it's suggested to manually initialize the router. (Introduced in version 1.1.1-rc2)
- **TheRouterFlowTask.THEROUTER_INITIALIZATION**: Executes tasks after TheRouter is initialized, handling related dependencies. (Introduced in version 1.1.2-rc6)


### Customized business node initialization

Support defining business nodes, such as initializing certain methods only after the privacy protocol is approved:  

In fact, the two default lifecycle tasks of the framework are also completed through this capability.  


```java
// Assuming the privacy protocol task name is：AgreePrivacyCache

/**
 * Initialize the recording SDK after agreeing to the privacy agreement
 */
 @FlowTask(taskName="initRecord", dependsOn="AgreePrivacyCache")
 fun init(context:Context) = initRecordAudioSDK()

// When the user agrees to the privacy protocol, schedule the execution of all tasks that rely on the privacy protocol
TheRouter.runTask("AgreePrivacyCache")
```

### Compilation time configuration

1. `@FlowTask` `dependsOn` parameter declares a non-existent task, which is usually due to a writing error in the task name. It is recommended to set it to 'error' and detect the problem as early as possible during compilation.

Compilation time properties can be configured in 'local. properties' (`warning` outputs logs, `error` directly reports)

-  `CHECK_FLOW_UNKNOW_DEPEND=warning` warning/error


2 . During compilation, if you want to know the total number of FlowTasks in the current APP and their dependencies, you can configure the compilation time properties in 'local. properties'. 

-    `SHOW_FLOW_DEPEND=true`  

The compilation effect is shown in the following figure:

## Limitations of initialization methods

Methods annotated with @FlowTask must adhere to the following restrictions:

- If it's Java, the method must be declared with `public static`.  
- If it's Kotlin, it is recommended to write it as a `top-level function`.  
- The method must have only one parameter of type `Context`, with the argument being an instance of `Application`.  

## Implementation principle
 
Each method annotated with `@FlowTask` is analyzed during the compilation process, generating a corresponding `Task` object. This object contains information about the initialization method, such as whether it executes asynchronously, the task name, and whether it depends on other tasks.

After all AARs have been compiled, creating all the `Task` objects, they are aggregated in the main app using the `Gradle plugin`. At this point, all `Task` objects are checked to prevent cyclic dependencies by building a `directed acyclic graph`.

Upon each application startup, during router initialization, all `Task` objects in the directed graph are loaded sequentially according to their dependency relationships.
