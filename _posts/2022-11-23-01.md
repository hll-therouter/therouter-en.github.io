TheRouter is an open-source routing framework developed by Huolala, specifically designed for the Android platform. It's an integrated framework that facilitates componentization, cross-module calls, and dynamic functionalities. It's essentially considered one of the most advanced routing libraries available today.     
Github: [https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-therouter-android/](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/hll-wp-therouter-android/)   

## Before You Start  

If your project has previously used other routers, it is recommended to use the migration tool for a one-click migration： [https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/09/05/01](https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/09/05/01)   

If you are starting a new project, remember one key point: `the version numbers for the plugin, apt, and router dependencies must be consistent`. Please continue reading below for the integration steps.   


## Checking the Latest Version

TheRouter has two types of versions: stable and rc (release candidate). Generally, if you are not seeking new features, the stable version should suffice. The latest version numbers and descriptions of various versions can be seen on the official website：[https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/09/06/01](https://en.therouter.cn/docs/2022/09/06/01)  

## Integration

Create a new `Demo` project and open the `build.gradle` file in the root directory of the `Demo`.

### First：classpath

####  8.X Gradle

Due to the requirements of Gradle version 8.X, it is necessary to use a `Java 17` environment. Additionally, it is not compatible with `class` files compiled with older versions of `JDK`. Therefore, for the new version, it is required to use plugins specifically compiled for `Java 17`.

```groovy
id 'cn.therouter.agp8' version '1.2.2' apply false
```

####  7.X Gradle

For Gradle 7.X, the `classpath` has been changed to be included using the `plugins` method. You just need to add this line within the closure:

```groovy
id 'cn.therouter' version '1.2.2' apply false
```

#### For Gradle version 6.X and earlier versions:

For Gradle version 6.X and earlier, you need to manually include the `classpath`.  
Instructions for integration can also be found on the official Github homepage of TheRouter.   

```groovy
classpath "cn.therouter:plugin:1.2.2"
```

### Two：Integrate the Plugin

#### For Gradle Version 7.X and Later Versions

Locate all the app modules in the project (usually there's only one, but some special projects may have multiple). This means in all the `build.gradle` files of the entire project, for any module that includes `com.android.application`, you need to add the following code:

```groovy
// For Gradle version 7.X and newer versions, you should write it like this:
id 'therouter'
```

#### For Gradle version 6.X and earlier versions:

Locate all the app modules in the project (usually there's only one, but some special projects may have multiple). This means in all the `build.gradle` files of the entire project, for any module that includes `com.android.application`, you need to add the following code:

```groovy
// For Gradle version 6.X and earlier versions, write it like this:
apply plugin: 'therouter'
```

### Three: Integrate the Annotation Processor

The latest version of TheRouter now supports `KSP`(Kotlin Symbol Processing) parsing. If you're not familiar with what `KSP` is, then continue reading below and use `kapt`(Kotlin Annotation Processing Tool). If you wish to use `KSP`, you can refer to the documentation: [Using KSP for Annotation Processing](https://therouter.cn/docs/2023/05/15/01)。    
  
TheRouter's annotation processing relies on `kapt` for execution. Therefore, it must be manually integrated into the project; otherwise, annotation processing cannot be performed.   

**Note: All modules must integrate kapt, otherwise, there might be a possibility of some routing tables not being generated.**  
**Note: For all app modules, especially those intended for release, they must be directly or indirectly depended upon in the app. Otherwise, the final generated APK may lack functionalities from modules that are not depended upon.**  

<img src="https://therouter.cn/assets/img/image/6.jpg" class="blog-img">

If you encounter an error stating that `kapt` cannot be found, it may be because the `kotlin-kapt` plugin is not declared. Refer to the screenshot in `Step Two` and integrate the corresponding `kapt`.    
For pure Java projects, you need to use Java's `APT`(Annotation Processing Tool). In this case, you don't need to declare the `kotlin-kapt` plugin. Instead, simply replace `kapt` with `annotationProcessor`  


```groovy
annotationProcessor "cn.therouter:apt:1.2.2"
```

### Four: Integrate the Routing Library

In the `build.gradle` file of the module where you need to use the routing functionality (unlike `kapt`, this can use transitive dependencies), add the following dependency:    

```
dependencies {
    implementation "cn.therouter:router:1.2.2"
}
```


## Usage

#### 1. Declare Routes

Add route table declarations to the pages that need to be navigated to.  

```java
@Route(path = "http://therouter.com/home")
public class HomeActivity extends BaseActivity {
}
```

#### 2. Add parameter injection.

If you have already implemented this in the base class, you don't need to add it to each individual activity.   

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    TheRouter.inject(this);
}
```

#### 3. Initiate the navigation.

In other words, you can replace the previous usage of `startActivity()` with this method.  

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    TheRouter.build("target page Path")
        .withInt("intValue", 12345678) 
        .withString("str_123_Value", "support 中文字符串")
        .withBoolean("boolValue", true)
        .withLong("longValue", 123456789012345L)
        .withChar("charValue", 'c')
        .withDouble("double", 3.14159265358972)
        .withFloat("floatValue", 3.14159265358972F)
        .navigation();
        
    TheRouter.build("no params dont need with method").navigation();
}
```

## AGP 8.X 

When using it, just pay attention to the difference mentioned in the first step of this document, where the classpath should be included using `cn.therouter.agp8` for the plugin.
