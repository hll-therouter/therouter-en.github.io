      <h3 class="lead"> TheRouter boasts four key capabilities: </h3><hr>
      <p>Navigator:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support Activity, Fragment, ViewController</li>
        <li>Page paths support declaration using regular expressions.</li>
        <li>Supports exporting route tables in JSON and plist formats.</li>
        <li>Supports dynamic delivery of JSON route tables, degrading any page to H5.</li>
        <li>Supports interception handling of page navigation.</li>
        <li>Supports custom parsing of page parameters (e.g., parsing JSON into objects).</li>
        <li>Supports navigating to Activity (Fragment) in third-party SDKs using routes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>ServiceProvider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supports cross-module dependency injection.</li>
        <li>Supports custom creation rules for injection items.</li>
        <li>Supports custom service interception and single-module mock debugging.</li>
        <li>Supports injection object caching, with only one new object created for multiple injections.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>FlowTaskExecutor:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supports independent initialization of a single module.</li>
        <li>Supports lazy loading initialization.</li>
        <li>Independent initialization allows multiple task dependencies (similar to Gradle Task).</li>
        <li>Supports compile-time circular reference detection.</li>
        <li>Supports custom business initialization timing, addressing privacy compliance.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>ActionManager:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supports global callback configuration.</li>
        <li>Supports priority response and interrupt response.</li>
        <li>Supports recording call paths for debugging Observables in observer mode.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3> About TheRouter </h3><hr>
      <p>TheRouter is an open-source solution framework developed by Huolala Technology, suitable for Android/iOS modular development. It has advantages such as high dynamism, remote delivery, and dual-end consistency. It not only decouples regular module dependencies and page navigation but also provides solutions to common problems in the modularization process.
      </p>
      <h4 class="lead" id="anchor1"> Why Use TheRouter </h4><hr>
      <p>Routing is an indispensable function in modern mobile development, especially for enterprise-level apps. It can decouple the strong dependency relationship of Intent page navigation and reduce the mutual dependency issues between teams in cross-team development.
      </p>
      <p>TheRouter is a complete set of solutions dedicated to modular development, supporting both Android and iOS. It not only decouples regular module dependencies and page navigation but also provides solutions to common problems in the modularization process. It perfectly solves the problem of unable to obtain external module lifecycle and business processes within the component, resulting in the need to modify code across modules for each initialization and dependent call.</p>
